# Contributing To Terrain3D

We need your help to make this the best terrain plugin for Godot.

Please see [System Design](https://github.com/TokisanGames/Terrain3D/wiki/System-Design) to gain an understanding of how the system works. Then review the [roadmap](https://github.com/users/TokisanGames/projects/3) for priority of issues.

If you wish to take on a major component, it's best to join our discord and discuss your plans with Cory to make sure your efforts are aligned to other plans.

## Setup Your System

Make sure you are setup to [build the plugin from source](https://github.com/TokisanGames/Terrain3D/wiki/Building-From-Source). 

## PR Workflow

We use the standard [Godot PR workflow](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/workflow/pr_workflow.html). Please submit PRs according to the same process Godot uses.

## Code Style

### GDScript

In general, follow the [Godot GDScript style guidelines](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html). 
In addition:
* All variables and functions are static typed, with a colon then space (eg. `var state: int = 3`)
* Auto static typing can be used *only* when the type is specifically assigned (eg. `var point := Vector2(1, 1)`)
* Two blank lines between functions

### GLSL

* Similar to C++ formatting below, except use `float` and no clang-format
* Private uniforms are prefaced with `_` and are hidden from the inspector and not accessible via set/get_shader_param()

### C++

In general, follow the [Godot C++ style guidelines](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/development/code_style_guidelines.html).
In addition:

Floats:
* Use `real_t` instead of `float`
* Format float literals like `0.0f`
* Float literals and `real_t` variables can share operations (e.g. `mydouble += 1.0f`) unless the compiler complains. e.g. `Math::lerp(mydouble, real_t(0.0f), real_t(1.0f))`

Braces:
* Everything braced - no if/for one-liners. Including switch cases
* One line setters/getters can go in the header file
* Opening brace on the initial line (eg. `if (condition) {`), and ending brace at the same tab stop as the initial line

Private & Public:
* Private variables/functions prefaced with `_`
* Private/public/protected explicit and grouped together in that order, in header and cpp files
* Functions in h and cpp files in same order

Other formatting:
* One blank line between functions
* All code passed through clang-format. See below

#### clang-format

clang-format will adjust the style of your code to a consistent standard. Once you install it you can manually run it on all of your code to see or apply changes, and you can set it up to run automatically upon each commit.

##### Installing clang-format binary onto your system.
* Download version 13 or later
* Make sure the LLVM binary directory where `clang-format` is stored gets added to the `PATH` during installation
* Linux/OSX: Install the `clang-format` package, or all of `LLVM` or `clang` if your distribution doesn't provide the standalone tool
* Windows: Download LLVM for Windows from <https://releases.llvm.org/download.html>

##### Using clang-format automatically

We use Godot's clang-format hooks that will format your code upon making a commit. Install the hooks into your repo after cloning.

* Copy `tools/hooks/*` into `.git/hooks` or run `python tools/install-hooks.py`

##### Using clang-format manually

* View a formatted file, no changes on disk: `clang-format <filenames>`
* See what changes would be made: `git-clang-format --diff <filenames>`
* Change the files in place: `clang-format -i <filenames>`
